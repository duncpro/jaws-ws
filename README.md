# JAWS-WS
Boilerplate Gradle project for developing web-socket based APIs using Amazon Web Services and Java.
This repository demonstrates integration testing of API endpoints, deployment of an API Gateway
Web Sockets API via the AWS CDK, and implementation of a serverbound message handler.

## Motivation
While AWS's documentation is thorough, I find that it's much easier to get started with a new technology
by looking at working examples. This repository is intended to make building a serverless web-socket application
easier for Java developers like myself. See also [JAWS-REST](https://github.com/duncpro/jaws-rest).
